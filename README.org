#+title: Run C snippet on pico RISC-V core with simulator
#+subtitle: A step by step guide
#+author: Yù Chāngyuǎn

* warm up
** what we want
- C code snippet
#+begin_src c
  int main()
  {
    putStrLn("Hello, world!");
  }
#+end_src
- run on RISC-V core, in software way
** what we have
- gcc riscv32 toolchain, for cross compile
- iverilog, for simulate verilog hardware description
- picorv32, a 32bit RISC-V core, in verilog source form
** how to
- top-down
  + reverse to ordinary condition
  + design hardware to make software run easily
- step
  + complete trival C code to a full project
  + design hardware peripheral, according to C project
  + wrap up & run the code, with simulator
  + more experiment
* software(C code)
* hardware(verilog HDL)
